# RandomBits
This repo contains random bits of useful code that solves problems I stumble upon when working with AL and control add-ins.

## Content

There are two folders right now:
* `al`: Contains AL bits. Actually, this one is empty for now.
* `js`: Contains JavaScript bits. There is content inside, take a look!
